# ðŸš¦ Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

**Sorting Algorithm Visualizer** is an interactive web tool built with **React.js** that brings sorting algorithms to life. It animates array operations step-by-step so learners can see how different algorithms work and compare their behavior and performance.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Real-Time Visualization** â€” Watch every comparison, swap and movement as animations.
- **Multiple Algorithms** â€” Implements 5 core sorting algorithms for side-by-side comparison.
- **Interactive Controls**
  - **Algorithm Selection** â€” Pick which algorithm to visualize.
  - **Speed Control** â€” 5 animation speed levels.
  - **Array Size** â€” Customize array size (up to 100 elements).
  - **Generate New Array** â€” Create a fresh random array at any time.
  - **Pause / Resume** â€” Control the animation flow.
- **Educational Focus** â€” Designed for students and developers to understand sorting behavior and complexity.
- **Used by learners** â€” (Optional) Used by 50+ learners for study and teaching.
